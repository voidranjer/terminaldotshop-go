    "question": "is ordering via ssh secure?",

  {
    "question": "what is cron?",
    "answer": "cron is our monthly membership, available only in the US (for now). if you subscribe, you'll receive a new coffee blend every month, along with other suprises both physical and digital. learn more at trm.sh/cron. subscribe with `ssh terminal.shop -t cron`."
  },
  {
    "question": "i tried to subscribe to cron, but it says i need a public key?",
    "answer": "we don't allow subscriptions without a public key, as you won't be able to ssh back in with the same identity (we treat users without a public key as anonymous). create a key with `ssh-keygen -t rsa` and make sure your ssh client isn't omitting your key."
  },
  {
    "question": "how do you store my data?",
    "answer": "we store minimal information about you when you order through our ssh shop: name, shipping address and email, along with a fingerprint generated from your public key. all payment information is stored exclusively by Stripe."
  },
  {
    "question": "do you offer a subscription?",
    "answer": "in addition to cron, our monthly membership, you can also subscribe to any of the blends offered in our shop. subscribe after completing a purchase in the shop, or create a subscription with our API: trm.sh/api."
